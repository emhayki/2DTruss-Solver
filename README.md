## Description

The 2D Truss Problem Solver is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Python, aimed at facilitating the analysis and solution of 2D truss problems. It provides an intuitive interface for inputting truss configurations and loads, performing calculations, and visualising the resulting forces and deformations.

## Features

- Interactive GUI for straightforward input and modification of truss configurations
- Visualisation of truss structures and results
- Calculation of nodal displacements and member forces
- Results presented in a clear, tabular format

## Installation

To run the 2D Truss Problem Solver, Python must be installed on your system, along with several dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tkinter` (should be included with Python)
- `tabulate`

### Usage
- Input the geometry of the truss structure, including nodes and members.
- Specify loads and boundary conditions.
- Run the analysis to calculate nodal displacements and member forces.
- View the resulting analysis.
